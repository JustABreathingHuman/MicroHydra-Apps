short_description: Watch a boid simulation unfold.

description: |
  This app randomly arranges a bunch of [boids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) (and obsticals), and simulates them.  
  You can also hit enter to get a new random setup, or hold space to speed up the obsticals.
  
  This app randomly selects one of a few different pre-determined sets of input parameters.  
  Then, randomly places boids and (randomly sized) obsticals around the screen.
