`mystify` is screensaver-like application that displays a moving and bouncing polygon with rainbow trails, styled after "Mystify Your Mind" that once came with MS Windows.
This particular implementation was heavily influenced and inspired by this reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/CardPuter/comments/1btnrxi/mystify_screensaver_for_microhydra/ .
